[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A comprehensive solution for controlling multiple servo motors using the ESP32 NodeMCU 32s and PCA9685 PWM controller. This project provides a flexible and robust way to control servos through both serial commands and the Evolutronix/Robotics user interface.

## Overview
This repository contains the necessary code and documentation to set up and control multiple servo motors simultaneously. The PCA9685 16-channel PWM controller enables precise control over servo positioning, making it ideal for robotics projects, automation systems, and other motion control applications.

## Features
- Control up to 16 servo motors simultaneously
- Dual control options:
 - Serial command interface
 - Evolutronix/Robotics UI integration
- Configurable servo parameters
- Easy-to-use API for servo control
- Smooth motion control
- Compatible with most standard servo motors

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 NodeMCU 32s
